Examples, homeworks, and other materials for the programming language course by Dan Grossman: https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages 


## Installation

### Emacs

Install emacs, as usual.

For spacemacs, there's `sml` layer.

### SMLNJ

This can be installed on macOS via homebrew but unfortunately it doesn't work out of the box.
The problem seems to be that the .pkg file isn't trusted by the system.
